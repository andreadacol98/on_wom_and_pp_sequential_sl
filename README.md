# On Word-of-Mouth and Private-Prior Sequential Social Learning

## Abstract
Social learning constitutes a fundamental framework for studying interactions among rational agents who observe each other’s actions but lack direct access to individual beliefs. 
This paper investigates a specific social learning paradigm known as Word-of-Mouth (WoM), where a series of agents seeks to estimate the state of a dynamical system. 
The first agent receives noisy measurements of the state, while each subsequent agent relies solely on a degraded version of her predecessor’s estimate. 
A defining feature of WoM is that the final agent’s belief is publicly broadcast and subsequently adopted by all agents, in place of their own. 
We analyze this setting theoretically and through numerical simulations, noting that some agents benefit from using the belief of the last agent, while others experience performance degradation.
